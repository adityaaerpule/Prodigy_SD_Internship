Java Projects - Internship at Prodigy Infotech
This repository contains the Java projects completed as part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech. Each project focuses on a different aspect of Java programming, including user input handling, random number generation, file handling, and more.

Projects
1. Temperature Converter
A Java program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user can input a temperature value and choose the unit of measurement, and the program will display the equivalent temperatures in the other units.

Features
Accepts user input for temperature and unit of measurement.
Converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Handles invalid input with error messages.
2. Number Guessing Game
A fun number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and counts the number of attempts made.

Features
Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
Accepts user input for guesses and provides feedback.
Counts the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
3. Contact Manager
A contact management system that allows users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts. The contact details are stored in a file named contacts.txt, which can be loaded and saved for persistent storage.

Features
Add new contacts with name, phone number, and email.
View all contacts stored in the system.
Edit existing contacts' details.
Delete contacts by name.
Save contacts to a file and load them on startup.
